# First-Project_Income-Dashboard
## Introduction
This is the first Python project that me, Iqbal, and my partner Viet worked on during the university course "Financial Economics with Python". We wanted to gather income data in germany in visualize our finding in python via streamlit. We mainly used the StepStone 2023 Income Report as a source which provided median data points and was based on a reserach consisting of over 600.000 data points.

## Main Features:
- Web Scraper linked with Gehalt.de (type in keywords in the searchbar)
- Many Plots linked to different filter options e.g. education level, different locations in germany, responsibility, company size

## Issues and Considerations:
- Plots of Income Level in relation to education level / degree are based on mean values not median
--> Same Plots should be expanded to have a better view on the data
- To have a better user experience, it is recommended to close the sidebar so that images and plots don't overlap
